#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I only use this account to contribute to repositories hosted on Github.

I've moved all my repositories over to [SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org/). You can find them here: https://git.sr.ht/~dennis/



> Good code is written when people are focused, thinking hard about a problem while having the time to grasp the big picture. Modern Github seems to be purposely built as a tool to avoid people thinking about what they do and discourage them from writing anything but a new JavaScript framework.
